text:
- to be, or not to be, that is the question,
- whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
- the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
- or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
- and by opposing end them? to die to sleep;
- no more; and by a sleep to say we end
- the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
- that flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
- devoutly to be wish'd. to die, to sleep;
- to sleep, perchance to dream ay, there's the rub;
- for in that sleep of death what dreams may come
- when we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
- must give us pause there's the respect
- that makes calamity of so long life;
- for who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
- the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
- the pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
- the insolence of office and the spurns
- that patient merit of the unworthy takes,
- when he himself might his quietus make
- with a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
- to grunt and sweat under a weary life,
- but that the dread of something after death,
- the undiscover'd country from whose bourn
- no traveller returns, puzzles the will
- and makes us rather bear those ills we have
- than fly to others that we know not of?
- thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
- and thus the native hue of resolution
- is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
- and enterprises of great pith and moment
- with this regard their currents turn awry,
- and lose the name of action.
- the fair ophelia! nymph, in thy orisons
- be all my sins remember'd.

- From fairest creatures we desire increase,
- That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
- But as the riper should by time decease,
- His tender heir might bear his memory
- But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
- Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
- Making a famine where abundance lies,
- Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
- Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
- And only herald to the gaudy spring,
- Within thine own bud buriest thy content
- And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
- Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
- To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

- now is the winter of our discontent
- made glorious summer by this sun of york;
- and all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
- in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
- now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
- our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
- our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
- our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
- grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
- and now, instead of mounting barbed steeds
- to fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
- he capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
- to the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
- but i, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
- nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
- i, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
- to strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
- i, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
- cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
- deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
- into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
- and that so lamely and unfashionable
- that dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
- why, i, in this weak piping time of peace,
- have no delight to pass away the time,
- unless to spy my shadow in the sun
- and descant on mine own deformity
- and therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
- to entertain these fair well-spoken days,
- I am determined to prove a villain
- and hate the idle pleasures of these days.
- plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
- by drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
- to set my brother clarence and the king
- in deadly hate the one against the other
- and if king edward be as true and just
- as I am subtle, false and treacherous,
- this day should clarence closely be mew'd up,
- about a prophecy, which says that 'g'
- of edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
- dive, thoughts, down to my soul, here clarence comes.

- in faith, I will. let me peruse this face.
- mercutio's kinsman, noble county paris!
- what said my man, when my betossed soul
- did not attend him as we rode? I think
- he told me paris should have married juliet
- said he not so? or did I dream it so?
- or am I mad, hearing him talk of juliet,
- to think it was so? o, give me thy hand,
- one writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
- i'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
- a grave? o no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
- for here lies juliet, and her beauty makes
- this vault a feasting presence full of light.
- death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
- how oft when men are at the point of death
- have they been merry! which their keepers call
- a lightning before death, o, how may i
- call this a lightning? o my love! my wife!
- death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
- hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
- thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
- is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
- and death's pale flag is not advanced there.
- tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
- o, what more favour can I do to thee,
- than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
- to sunder his that was thine enemy?
- forgive me, cousin! ah, dear juliet,
- why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
- that unsubstantial death is amorous,
- and that the lean abhorred monster keeps
- thee here in dark to be his paramour?
- for fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
- and never from this palace of dim night
- depart again, here, here will I remain
- with worms that are thy chamber-maids; o, here
- will I set up my everlasting rest,
- and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
- from this world-wearied flesh. eyes, look your last!
- arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, o you
- the doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
- a dateless bargain to engrossing death!
- come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
- thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
- the dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
- here's to my love!
- o true apothecary!
- thy drugs are quick. thus with a kiss I die.


- blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
- you cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
- till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
- you sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
- vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
- singe my white head! and thou, all-shaking thunder,
- smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
- crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once,
- that make ingrateful man!

- all the world's a stage
- and all the men and women merely players
- they have their exits and their entrances;
- and one man in his time plays many parts,
- his acts being seven ages. at first the infant,
- mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
- and then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
- and shining morning face, creeping like snail
- unwillingly to school. and then the lover,
- sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
- made to his mistress' eyebrow. then a soldier,
- full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
- jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
- seeking the bubble reputation
- even in the cannon's mouth. and then the justice,
- in fair round belly with good capon lined,
- with eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
- full of wise saws and modern instances;
- and so he plays his part. the sixth age shifts
- into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
- with spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
- his youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
- for his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
- turning again toward childish treble, pipes
- and whistles in his sound. last scene of all,
- that ends this strange eventful history,
- is second childishness and mere oblivion,
- sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

- a horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

- if we shadows have offended,
- think but this, and all is mended,
- that you have but slumber'd here
- while these visions did appear.
- and this weak and idle theme,
- no more yielding but a dream,
- gentles, do not reprehend
- if you pardon, we will mend
- and, as I am an honest puck,
- if we have unearned luck
- now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
- we will make amends ere long;
- else the puck a liar call;
- so, good night unto you all.
- give me your hands, if we be friends,
- and robin shall restore amends.


- done to death by slanderous tongues
- was the hero that here lies
- death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
- gives her fame which never dies.
- so the life that died with shame
- lives in death with glorious fame.
- hang thou there upon the tomb,
- praising her when I am dumb.
- now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
- pardon, goddess of the night,
- those that slew thy virgin knight;
- for the which, with songs of woe,
- round about her tomb they go.
- midnight, assist our moan;
- help us to sigh and groan,
- heavily, heavily
- graves, yawn and yield your dead,
- till death be uttered, heavily, heavily.

- if it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
- it were done quickly if the assassination
- could trammel up the consequence, and catch
- with his surcease success; that but this blow
- might be the be-all and the end-all here,
- but here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
- we'ld jump the life to come. but in these cases
- we still have judgment here; that we but teach
- bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
- to plague the inventor this even-handed justice
- commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
- to our own lips. he's here in double trust;
- first, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
- strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
- who should against his murderer shut the door,
- not bear the knife myself. besides, this duncan
- hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
- so clear in his great office, that his virtues
- will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
- the deep damnation of his taking-off;
- and pity, like a naked new-born babe,
- striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
- upon the sightless couriers of the air,
- shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
- that tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
- to prick the sides of my intent, but only
- vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other.

- Her father loved me; oft invited me;
- Still question'd me the story of my life,
- From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
- That I have passed.
- I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
- To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
- Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
- Of moving accidents by flood and field
- Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
- Of being taken by the insolent foe
- And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
- And portance in my travels' history
- Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
- Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
- It was my hint to speak, such was the process;
- And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
- The AnthropophagI and men whose heads
- Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
- Would Desdemona seriously incline
- But still the house-affairs would draw her thence
- Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
- She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
- Devour up my discourse which I observing,
- Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
- To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
- That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
- Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
- But not intentively I did consent,
- And often did beguile her of her tears,
- When I did speak of some distressful stroke
- That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
- She gave me for my pains a world of sighs
- She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
- T was pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful
- She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
- That heaven had made her such a man she thank'd me,
- And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
- I should but teach him how to tell my story.
- And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake
- She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
- And I loved her that she did pity them.
- This only is the witchcraft I have used
- Here comes the lady; let her witness it.

- The little Love-god lying once asleep
- Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
- Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
- Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
- The fairest votary took up that fire
- Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
- And so the general of hot desire
- Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
- This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
- Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
- Growing a bath and healthful remedy
- For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,
- Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
- Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
